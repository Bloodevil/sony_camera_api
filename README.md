    pip install pysony

using repo:

    git clone https://github.com/Bloodevil/sony_camera_api.git
    python setup.py install

Running tests
=============

You will likely want to set up a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) first and complete the following steps inside it.

Install requirements:

	pip install -r test-requirements.txt

Run tests:

	python -m unittest discover

(The `run_tests.sh` script does both of these automatically)

By default, the test suite verifies behavior locally using dummy services.

If you want to run tests live against your real camera, connect to the camera's
wireless access point and set the `TEST_LIVE_CAMERA` environment variable.
For example:

	TEST_LIVE_CAMERA=1 python -m unittest discover
